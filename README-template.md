## Overview

-   4th challenge now i believe, really enjoying it and getting the hang of the HTML CSS ones. Practice really is helping!
-   Mainly doing these on mobile (Acode) which takes longer and has added complexity when upscaling to browser view but thoroughly enjoying it still! Might try another JS one next ;)

-   ### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

-   Started with the HTML, giving basic structure to the elements.
-   Added CSS, starting with the container and outer box.
-   Worked from the outside in until the structure was correct.
-   Styled the outer box from the top down.
-   Upscaled from mobile to browser view.

### Built with

-   Acode
-   HTML
-   CSS

### What I learned

-   Found this one really easy!
-   Used variables for colors and gave rem a go instead of px... Maybe thats why scaling up wasnt such hassle?

### Continued development

-   Continue using rem to get a real feel for it.
